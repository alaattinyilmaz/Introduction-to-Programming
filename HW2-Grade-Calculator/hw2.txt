inputs 
Student name,
midterm grades, 
final grade 
average of the homework grades

The program starts with displaying a welcome message that explains your program. 
Next phase is
input entry for two separate students. 

RULES

0 <= exam grades <= 100 integers

-100 <= homework average <= 100 ? - must be real number

20 =< final  -otherwise F 

MT1(25%), MT2(25%), F(35%), HW(15%) { (mt1 + mt2) * 0.25 + f * 0.35 + hw * 0.15 } 

35 =< exam average  -otherwise F { ((mt1 + mt2) * 0.25 + f * 0.35) / 0.85 }

Homeaverage > 2 * examaverage -gradelower a letter grade { HW_average > 2 * Exam_Average }


Letter Points
A >90
A- >85
B+ >80
B >75
B- >70
C+ >60
C >55
C- >50
D+ >45
D >40


Functions

function1 
{
to prompt for the inputs  from user, calls function2 with inputted parameters
}


function2
{
takes parameters, checks input. If there is no mistake calls function3 

OTHERWISE 
Gives error messages
else if (1. Exams can be [0,100] 2. Homework average grade can be [-100,100])
}


function3
{
this function takes all the valid inputs and check rule 3,4,6,7
3. Your midterm grades must add up to 40 (mt1+mt2) to pass the course, otherwise the letter
grade will be F.
4. Your final grade must be at least 20 to pass the course, otherwise the letter grade will be F.
5. The distribution is: MT1(25%), MT2(25%), F(35%), HW(15%)
6. The exam average must be at least 35 to pass the course, otherwise the letter grade will be F.
7. If homework average is larger than the double of the exam average, then the grade will be
lowered by a letter grade

It will also calculate the total points (Rule 5)

after calculations it calls Function4
}


function4
{
calculates letter grade by looking at total point. So, you have to
pass some of the variables from Function3 to Function4.
}


main function
{
Displays welcome message
Moreover, you will call Function1 from main twice for the two different students.
